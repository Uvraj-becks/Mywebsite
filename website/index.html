            HELLO GUYS! SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LEARN HACKING FOR FREE, 
            IT IS POSSIBLE AND CAN BE DONE EASILY. FIRST THING IS THAT YOU JUST GET STARTED.
            NEXT KNOW THE BASCIS AND GET COMFORTABLE WITH KALI LINUX BASICS.
            IF YOU ASK , <strong>DO I NEED TO KNOW PROGRAMMING?</strong> ANSWER IS NO.
            YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND CODE, SO THAT YOU CAN CAREFULLY INJECT CODE FROM PLACES LIKE GITHUB TO YOUR APPLICATIONS.
            BUT NOTHING IS BAD IN LEARNING PROGRAMMING SIDE BY SIDE, YOU CAN JUST GET STARTED WITH PYTHON.
            NEXT KNOW THE NETWORKING, SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, AND ALL THE IT FUNDAMNETALS.
